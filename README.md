# CryptoClustering

## Crypto Clustering Analysis
This project involves the clustering analysis of cryptocurrencies. The notebook Crypto_Clustering.ipynb provides a comprehensive guide and implementation for clustering cryptocurrencies based on various features.

## Overview
The notebook is structured as follows:

Prepare the Data: Initial preparation and processing of the cryptocurrency data.

Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame: This section involves determining the optimal number of clusters (k) for K-means clustering using the scaled data.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data: Implementation of K-means clustering with the determined value of k on the original scaled data.

Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Application of PCA to optimize the clustering process.

Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data: Similar to step 2, but this time using the data transformed by PCA.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data: Clustering implementation on the PCA-transformed data.

Determine the Weights of Each Feature on each Principal Component: Analysis of feature importance in the principal components.

Each section contains detailed explanations and code implementations, along with questions and prompts to guide the analysis.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: [libraries used in the notebook, e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.]
Usage
To run this notebook:
